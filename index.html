                <p> I'm from a little island in the Caribbean called Trinidad and Tobago üáπüáπ . I grew up always wanting to be an engineer. I've always liked taking things apart and putting it back together. I decided to pursue a Degree in Mechanical Engineering and worked for some really good companies, I was out in the field getting dirty and using my hands to fix things. As i got older i realized that there was a need for software development and i decided to pursue a degree in Information Technology. I'm still new to the field, and keep trying to learn and grow both in the engineering and software development space. I'm always open to learning new things and meeting new people.</p>
                <p> In 2020 (before the world was turned upside down) my wife an I decided to move to Canada. We packed up everything we had, and our dog Majic üê∂ and hoped on a plane to Canada. We were all over Ontario looking for Jobs when we landed in a little town called Listowel. We both started working at nearby towns and have been growing and learning ever since. We both love exploring the great white north and still amazed at the beauty of nature. Just when you think you've seen it all, something new and amazing always comes along. We are always looking for a new adventure. </p>
